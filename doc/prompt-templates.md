## Song Link Translator

```
Use the given screenshot to extract the song title and artist. It should be obvious which song it is because the screenshot should depict either a single song or in cases where thereâ€™s more than one song, use the song that is selected and/or currently playing.

Next, craft direct song URLs (not search links) and render them as clickable links for the following platforms:
  Spotify
  YouTube
  SoundCloud
  Apple Music

If the song is unavailable on any of these platforms, note that explicitly. If direct links cannot be generated for any reason, explain why and provide a solution.

Ensure the links point directly to the playable song page, not a search page.
